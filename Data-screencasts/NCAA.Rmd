## NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament




```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 41)
tournament <- tuesdata$tournament
```




## How are structured data ?

In this part, I wanna know the data behavior, for this I use `skmir` package.

```{r}
tournament%>%
  skim()
```

Other alternative is :

```{r}
summary(tournament)%>%
  skim()
```





## Exploratory Data Analysis 

with this functiuÃ³n you cand find the frecuency for the general  total

```{r}
tournament%>%
  count(year)%>%
  count(n)
```

```{r}
tournament<-tournament%>%
  filter(year>=1994)
```




```{r}
tournament%>%
  ggplot(aes(full_w, tourney_w + reg_w))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.1, color='blue')+
  labs(title = 'Regular Wins before the tournament')+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5))
```



```{r}
tournament%>%
  group_by(seed)%>%
  summarize(n=n(),
            pct_win=mean(tourney_finish=='Champ'))
```


For recreate levels

```{r}
levels<-c("1st","2nd","RSF","RF","NSF","N2nd","Champ")
tournament<-tournament%>%
  mutate(tourney_finish=fct_relevel(tourney_finish,levels))

tournament%>%
  group_by(seed)%>%
  summarize(n=n(),
            pct_win=mean(tourney_finish %in% c('Champ',"N2nd")))
```




```{r}
tournament%>%
  count(seed,tourney_finish)%>%
  group_by(seed)%>%
  mutate(pct= n/sum(n))%>%
  ggplot(aes(tourney_finish,seed,fill=pct))+
  geom_tile()+
  geom_text(aes(label=percent(round(pct,2))))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(1,16), expand = c(0,0))+
  scale_fill_gradient2(high = "blue", labels=percent)+
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())+
  labs(x='Tournament Finish (worst to best)',
       y='Strating Seed',
       fill='% of seed')
```



```{r}
tournament%>%
  group_by(seed)%>%
  summarize(n=n(),
            pct_win=mean(tourney_finish=='Champ'),
            avg_round=mean(as.integer(tourney_finish)))%>%
  ggplot(aes(seed,avg_round))+
  geom_line()
```
